#questions answered out of data - goal that NBA and NCAA wants

#-- i need to identify a problem/questions to answer - aka the reason i picked my DS - what's my problem specifically
#--EDA he would like to see
#--build classification model off of my questions
#what is the main point of this analysis
#good ex. from rafa


# is bam score a good predictor of players going to the next level?
# Is height/wingspan associated w vertical jump
# trends, outliers, relationship to bam score
# why is there a 37 inch height and 10.3 weight
# find weird stuff in data that may be a mistake - ask why it's here/where it's coming from

# how many nba games/min played - correlation between scores and games played ... also filter by position
# k nearest neighbors - 5 things that are most similarly athletically that played in the NBA
# -- ex. if you increase vertical jump x amount, number of people playing in nba goes up x amount




# group each of the raw results by groups of 10 or 3's to say these are the top, mid , bottom of the raw bam scores
### catagorical ranking - who did what well - is there a trend/train amonsgt the raw results that compares simarily to the nba
# what's the common characteritic that is in the top of the (varsity or whatever) rankings
## - martin says if they are good at 4 way agility they are good at all scores.
# what makes them different, stand out, etc.
# basketball players over practice jumping because they do this every day - but don't train direction changing 
# catagorize by rank - rank top to bottom for each category like I did for PGA DFS
# then see if in the top 25%, x percent were good at these categories.
# then rank them by body comp
## --> +1, +2, +3 (teams are looking at you) 




#martins hypothesis:
##top ranked high school atheletes are common amongst jump and sprint
#agility ????
